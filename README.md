# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm)

A simple terminal-based **Tic-Tac-Toe** game written in Python where a human player competes against an AI.  

## 🧠 About the AI

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to simulate and evaluate all possible game outcomes. This allows it to always make the best move, making it an unbeatable opponent.

- ✅ Unbeatable AI using Minimax with pruning  
- 🎯 Prioritizes fast victories and avoids losses  
- ♻️ Backtracking logic to simulate all game possibilities
